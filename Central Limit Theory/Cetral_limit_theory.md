#  What are the problem  that lead us for using "Central limit theory" ?

Let’s understand the central limit theorem with the help of an example. This will help you intuitively grasp how CLT works underneath.
Consider that there are 15 departments in the science department of a university, and each department hosts around 100 students. Our task is to calculate the average weight of students in the science department. Sounds simple, right?

**Answer :**
Does this approach make sense? Not really – measuring the weight of all the students will be a very tiresome and long process. So, what can we do instead? Let’s look at an alternate approach.


# What is the Definition of  "Central Limit Theory" /

Given a dataset with unknown distribution (it could be uniform, binomial or completely random), the sample means will approximate the normal distribution.

# What are the main steps for executing "Central Limit Theory" ?

1- Now, calculate the individual mean of these samples.

2- Then, calculate the mean of these sample means.

3- This value will give us the approximate mean weight of the students in the science department.

4- Additionally, the histogram of the sample mean weights of students will resemble a bell curve (or normal distribution).

# Distribution of the Variable in the Population  ?

Part of the definition for the central limit theorem states, “regardless of the variable’s distribution in the population.” This part is easy! In a population, the values of a variable can follow different probability distributions. These distributions can range from normal, left-skewed, right-skewed, and uniform, among others.

# Conditions of the Central Limit Theorem  ?


1- The sample size is sufficiently large. This condition is usually met if the size of the sample is n ≥ 30.

2- The samples are independent and identically distributed, i.e., random variables. The sampling should be random.

3- The population’s distribution has a finite variance. The central limit theorem doesn’t apply to distributions with infinite variance.

4- Sample size should be not more than 10% of the population when sampling is done without replacement


# What Is Standard Error?

In statistics, data from samples is used to understand larger populations. Standard error matters because it helps you estimate how well your sample data represents the whole population.


- A high standard error shows that sample means are widely spread around the population mean

- A low standard error shows that sample means are closely distributed around the population mean
