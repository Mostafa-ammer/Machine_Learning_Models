# What is Data Preprocessing?
is the process of transforming raw data into an understandable format. It is also an important step in data mining as we cannot work with raw data. The quality of the data should be checked before applying machine learning or data mining algorithms.

# Why is Data Preprocessing Important?
Preprocessing of data is mainly to check the data quality, and sure that data is ready for  using inside model 

# What are major Tasks in Data Preprocessing ?

There are 4 major tasks in data preprocessing – There are 4 major tasks in data preprocessing – Data cleaning, Data integration, Data reduction, and Data transformation., Data integration, Data reduction, and Data transformation.


# what is the meaning of data cleaning ?

Data cleaning is the process of removing incorrect data, incomplete data, and inaccurate data from the datasets, and it also replaces the missing values


# What are the major techniques for data cleaning ?

1- Missing values can also be filled manually, but it is not recommended when that dataset is big.

2- The attribute’s mean value can be used to replace the missing value when the data is normally distributed

3-  While using regression or decision tree algorithms, the missing value can be replaced by the most probable value.

# What is the meaning of "Noisy Data" ?
Noisy generally means random error or containing unnecessary data points

# Why handling "Noise data" is very important ?
Handling noisy data is one of the most important steps as it leads to the optimization of the model


# What is the meaning of "Data Integration" ?

The process of combining multiple sources into a single dataset or multiple  columns into one  column . The Data integration process is one of the main components of data management


# What is the meaning of "Data Reduction" ?

This process helps in the reduction of the volume of the data, which makes the analysis easier yet produces the same or almost the same result. This reduction also helps to reduce storage space. Some of the data reduction techniques are dimensionality reduction, numerosity reduction, and data compression.

# What is the meaning of Discretization ?

The continuous data here is split into intervals. Discretization reduces the data size. For example, rather than specifying the class time, we can set an interval like (3 pm-5 pm, or 6 pm-8 pm).
