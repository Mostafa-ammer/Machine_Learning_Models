# Dispersion of Data

1- Range : 

The range is the easiest dispersion of data or measure of variability. The range can measure by subtracting the lowest value from the massive Number. The wide range indicates high variability, and the small range specifies low variability in the distribution. To calculate a range, prepare all the values in ascending order, then subtract the lowest value from the highest value.

**Range = Highest_value  – Lowest_value**

The range can influence by outliers. If there is one extreme value that can change the value of a range.

2- Interquartile Range (IQR) :

IQR is a range (the boundary between the first and second quartile) and Q3 (the boundary between the third and fourth quartile).IQR is preferred over a range as, like a range, IQR does not influence by outliers. IQR is used to measure variability by splitting a data set into four equal quartiles.

# Formula to find outliers
  **[Q1 – 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR]**

3- Variance

Variance is a simple measure of dispersion. Variance measures how far each number in the dataset from the mean. To compute variance first, calculate the mean and squared deviations from a mean

4- Standard Deviation :

   Standard deviation is a squared root of the variance to get original values.

**68 % of values lie within 1 standard deviation.**

**95 % of values lies within 2 standard deviation.**

**99.7 % of values lie within 3 standard deviation.**
