# Decision Tree
is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for various types of data analysis and decision-making processes. Decision trees are particularly valuable for their simplicity, interpretability, and versatility.

# what are the disadvantages of decision tree ?
1- **Overfitting:** Decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially when the tree is deep and captures noise or specific patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data.


2-**Instability:** Decision trees can be sensitive to small variations in the training data. A slight change in the data can result in a completely different tree structure, leading to instability in the model.
