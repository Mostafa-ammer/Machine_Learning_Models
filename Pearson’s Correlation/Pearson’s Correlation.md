# What the values of  Pearson’s Correlation ?

Value of ‘r’ ranges from ‘-1’ to ‘+1’. Value ‘0’ specifies that there is no relation between the two variables. A value greater than ‘0’ indicates a positive relationship between two variables where an increase in the value of one variable increases the value of another variable. Value less than ‘0’ indicates a negative relationship between two variables where an increase in the value of one decreases the value of another variable.
