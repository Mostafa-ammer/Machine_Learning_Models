# What is Random forest ?
Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.

# What ensemble learning technique ?
Ensemble simplymeans combining multiple models. Thus a collection of models is used to make predictions rather than an individual model.

# what are types of Ensemble ?

1. Bagging– It creates a different training subset from sample training data with replacement & the final output is based on majority voting. For example,  Random Forest.


2. Boosting– It combines weak learners into strong learners by creating sequential models such that the final model has the highest accuracy. For example,  ADA BOOST, XG BOOST.
