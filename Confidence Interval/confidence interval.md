# What is the meaning of " Confidence interval "?
is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.

# What is the main equation for calculating "Confidence interval " ?

**Confidence Interval=Sample Statistic±Margin of Error**

-  where "Sample Statistic" is  sample mean 
 - The "Margin of Error" is a measure of the uncertainty in the estimate and is usually determined using the standard error
 - 
**Margin of Error=Critical Value×SE**'

**SE=sd/ √n**

Ex 1 :

You collected a sample of 100 test scores and found that the sample mean is 85, and the standard deviation (σ) of the population is 10.

- Calculate the standard error (SE):  sd/ √n = 10/√100=1

- Determine the critical value for a 95% confidence interval (for a large sample, it's approximately 1.96).

- Calculate the margin of error: Margin of Error=1.96×1=1.96Margin of Error=1.96×1=1.96

- Calculate the confidence interval: Confidence Interval=85±1.96=(83.04,86.96)Confidence Interval=85±1.96=(83.04,86.96)
