# The Measure of Central Tendencies

#  What the difference  between Population and Sample ?

** Population** :  the population is a collection of all data points of interest
      Example :   our aim to find out the total number of employees an organization is having. In this case, the total number of employees in the organization is known as                            population.



**sample  : **  sample is a subset of the population
    Our aim to find out the total number of employees on a particular project. In this case, the total number of employees in a project is known as a sample.

# What is the differnce between Parameter and Statistic ?

1- numbers that are obtained when working with a population are known as a **parameter**.

2- numbers that are obtained when working with a sample is known as a **statistic**

# How can we measure Measure of Central tendency ?

    By using Mean - Median - Mode 


**Mean**

Example :- Let’s consider first 10 natural numbers – 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

In this case, the mean will be the sum of all those numbers divided by the total number of numbers in questions.

( 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)/10 = 5.5


**Advantage of Mean **:

1.Easiest measure of central tendency

2.Easier to compute


**Disadvantage of Mean **:

1.Heavily affected by the presence of outlier



**Median** : 

This is the second measure of central tendency. Median is basically the middlemost data point in the dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order.
In this aspect, there are two variations of the median.

Median with even number of data points , If there are an even number of observations or data points, then the median is simply the average of the middle two numbers.

**Example :-**  Let’s consider first 10 natural numbers – 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

In this case, the median will be the average of the middle two numbers which is going to be 5.5


**Advantages of median:**

1.Higher resistance to outlier as compared to mean

**Disadvantages of median:**

1.Data needs to be ordered either in ascending or descending order



**Mode**
This is the third and last measure of central tendency. Mode is basically the value that appears the most in the dataset.

**Example:-** Let’s say we have following numbers – 1,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,6,7,8,9

Here we can clearly see that number 4 is repeated the most number of times and hence going to be mode in this case.

**Advantages of mode:**
1.Higher resistance to outlier as compared to mean and median

**Disadvantages of mode:**
1.Difficult to determine if data has more than 1 mode
