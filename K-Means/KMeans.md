 # what is KMeans Model ?
 
 machine learning algorithm used for clustering or grouping data points into K distinct and non-overlapping clusters. It's a popular unsupervised learning algorithm and is often used for tasks such as customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection. The main idea behind K-Means is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable "K."

# what are the main steps in KMeans Model ?

1- **Initialization:** The algorithm starts by randomly selecting K data points from the dataset as initial cluster centroids .

2- **Assignment":** For each data point in the dataset, the algorithm calculates the distance between the point and each of the K centroids. The data point is assigned to the cluster whose centroid is closest to it .

3- **Update Centroid:** : After assigning all data points to clusters, the algorithm updates the cluster centroids by computing the mean (average) of all data points assigned to each cluster. These new centroids represent the updated cluster centers .

4- Calculate Errror **(WCSS)** within class sum of square .


### Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)

The formula for calculating WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) in K-Means clustering is given as:

$$
WCSS = \sum_{i=1}^{K} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \left| x_{ij} - c_i \right|^2
$$

Where:
- \(WCSS\) is the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares.
- \(K\) is the number of clusters.
- \(n_i\) is the number of data points in cluster \(i\).
- \(x_{ij}\) represents the \(j\)-th data point in cluster \(i\).
- \(c_i\) is the centroid of cluster \(i\).

WCSS is used to evaluate the quality of clustering in K-Means and measures how close data points are to their respective cluster centroids. The goal is to minimize WCSS by adjusting the cluster centroids.

Feel free to use this equation in your README file to explain the concept of WCSS in the context of K-Means clustering.



5- **Repeat:** Steps 2 and 3 are repeated iteratively until a stopping criterion is met. The most common stopping criterion is when the centroids no longer change significantly or when a maximum number of iterations is reached

6- **Convergence Check:**Check if the centroids have changed significantly compared to the previous iteration. This is typically done by measuring the change in centroids' positions or the change in the total within-cluster variance (SSE - Sum of Squared Errors)



# what is the Output ?
The K-Means algorithm outputs the final cluster assignments for each data point and the coordinates of the cluster centroids.

# How can choose the optimal number of 'k' ?
The choice of the number of clusters (K) is crucial. There are various methods, such as the elbow method or silhouette analysis, to help determine the optimal K value based on the data's characteristics


## Elbow Method
elbow method can be used to get the the best value of 'k' based on the tradeoff between overfitting problem and the distortion (WCSS)

# what happen if the value of  ' k' is very large in elbow method ?

1-**Overfitting:** When you increase the number of clusters ('K'), each cluster tends to become smaller and more specialized. This can lead to overfitting, where clusters capture noise in the data rather than meaningful patterns. 
2-**Increased Computational Complexity:** As 'K' increases, the computational complexity of the K-Means algorithm grows significantly. The algorithm needs to calculate distances and update centroids for each cluster, making it slower and more resource-intensive. Large 'K' values can result in long training times.


# what happen if the value of  ' k' is very small in elbow method ?

1-**Underfitting:** When 'K' is too small, each cluster becomes too broad and may encompass diverse data points that do not belong to the same meaningful group. This results in an underfitting problem, where clusters fail to capture the true structure and patterns in the data
2-increase the value of error **(SSE - Sum of Squared Errors)**
